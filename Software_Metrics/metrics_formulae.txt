Halstead Metrics

Calculation - Reference Link: http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/help/GL_halstead.htm
First we need to compute the following numbers, given the program source code:

n1 = the number of distinct operators
n2 = the number of distinct operands
N1 = the total number of operators
N2 = the total number of operands
From these numbers, five measures can be calculated:

Program length: N = N1 + N2 
Program vocabulary: n = n1 + n2
Volume: V = N * log_2 (n) 
Difficulty : D = (n1/2)*(n2/N2)
Effort: E = D * V
The difficulty measure is related to the difficulty of the program to write or understand, e.g. when doing code review
